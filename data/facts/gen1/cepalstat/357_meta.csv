5000008,methodology,"It is the ratio of the number of deaths caused by tuberculosis occurred in total population in a given period, to the total estimated population of the country in the same period. The result is multiplied by 100,000."
5000009,commentary,"Where the only data available is data reported by the administration of health services, it is expressed per 100,000 inhabitants, using population estimates as denominator. In case that data is derived from household surveys, prevalence is also expressed per 100,000 inhabitants, using the total population in the survey as denominator.   Direct measures of the tuberculosis death rate come from vital statistics registration. Reliable figures require that death registration be nearly universal and that the cause of death be reported routinely on the death record and determined by a qualified observer according to the International Classification of Diseases. Generally such information is not available in developing countries. Vital statistics registration systems tend to underestimate tuberculosis deaths, although time series data from some countries in Asia and the Americas provide a useful indication of trends.   In the absence of direct measures of death rates, a variety of techniques can be used to estimate these values. Administrative data are derived from the administration of health services. Data can also be obtained from household surveys such as Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys or Demographic and Health Surveys, although they usually refer only to children less than five years of age and do not provide death rates. Population data directly or indirectly refers to population censuses.   Administrative data are, in principle, available annually. Data from surveys are generally available every three to five years. Results from population censuses are generally available every 10 years.   Limitations:   Tuberculosis death rate data reported by ministries in developing countries  usually reflects only a fraction of the total number of cases and deaths from tuberculosis in the population.  Estimates are published annually, in March, are available in<a href=""http://www.who.int/tb/country/global_tb_database/en"">WHOÂ’s Global TB Database</a>."
1659,note,"The figure is estimated by the international agency, when corresponding country data on a specific year or set of years are not available, or when multiple sources exist, or there are issues of data quality.  Estimates are based on national data, such as surveys or administrative records, or other sources but on the same variable being estimated.
