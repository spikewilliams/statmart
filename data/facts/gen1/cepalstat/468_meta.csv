5000008,methodology,It is the count of the number of available hospital beds in a given country and year.
5000009,commentary,"ECLACs Statistical Yearbook defines as hospital bed the one installed in a hospital institution where there is the necessary staff and equipment to allow the bed to be used regularly during 24 hours a day by hospitalized patients. The quality of this information depends on the structure of the health services system. When an institution or Ministry controls most of the hospitals, usually it is easier to obtain complete and comparable data; when this responsibility is shared among many institutions, public or private, this is more difficult. The World Health Organization (WHO) excludes from its definition of hospital bed obstetrics cradles and incubators, urgency services, those of postoperative recovery, as well as the ones used for diagnostic procedures and treatment (metabolism, rays, etc.). Neither are included those used for companions or personal lodging, neither those that are temporarily added because of greater emergencies demand."
