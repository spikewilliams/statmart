5000009,commentary,"Unemployment rates by country come from official sources, gathered by the Economic Development Division and used by ECLAC in its main economic publications. Data refers to ""open"" unemployment rates unless a note indicates that ""hidden"" unemployment is included.   We recommend users to consider the notes on time and regional coverage in each one of the countries. The case of Guatemala deserves a special mention given that, up to now, there is no official information from 1999 and 2001, and because the countrys Central Bank did not publish estimates of unemployment figures. Colombia from the year 2000 on presents data provided by a calculation that is not comparable to the previous one, since the unemployment survey currently used has national coverage and important methodological changes.   With respect to the regional total, depending on the number of countries incorporated in the calculation and for the purpose of comparability, users of this data should distinguish two periods. The first one covers the years 1981-1990 and includes 16 countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. In the second period, since 1991, the regional average includes, besides the 16 countries already mentioned, Barbados, Cuba, El Salvador, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and Trinidad and Tobago.   For some countries and years where official data is not available, the regional total includes ECLAC estimates. Given the non-official character of these estimates, they are not available in this database.   Data of this indicator differs from the values presented in BADEINSO for the indicator ""Rate of urban open unemployment by years of education, by sex (ECLAC)"", due to the fact that this indicator is obtained from special processing by ECLAC Statistics and Economic Projections Division on the basis of information coming from household surveys that usually provide unemployment levels for urban areas classified by sex. It is possible to observe that the unemployment figures obtained for both sexes are, in some countries, a little higher than those published by national sources.   These differences can be explained by different features of household surveys. One of the most important ones is that in some cases -such as Brazil, Chile, and Mexico- different surveys have been used to measure unemployment, surveys which differ in their sample designs, as well as in the instruments for data collection (questionnaire). Another aspect is that, even if it was the same survey, certain estimates differ in the geographical coverage of data, in spite of being presented as representative for the urban area of the country. As an example, from 1996 on, unemployment estimated for Bolivia through household surveys includes the whole urban area and not only departmental capitals, as it can be found in official measurements frequently used in ECLAC calculations. Finally, the reference period of figures also is important for the explanation of differences in unemployment calculation. For example, in some countries, the annual rate of unemployment corresponds to the average of the estimates made during a certain year on the basis of successive rounds of the same survey, while for calculations derived by special processing of household surveys sometimes only the most recent round of available surveys is considered.   Nevertheless, it is important to point out that both groups of figures show similar trends, and although a regional total is not calculated for countries with data calculated from household surveys, it is possible to agree on the fact that unemployment in Latin America and the Caribbean experienced an increase during the last decade.
